I am Ashish Singhal, a computer scientist and an AI research engineer. I grew up in one of the Mumbai suburbs enjoying the iconic Mumbai rains. I am currently working at an AI lab in a legal-tech company as Machine Learning Scientist where I am focussing on LLMs and Deep Learning.

I graduated from University of Twente majoring in data science. I have and currently working extensively in NLP domain. I would like to build 'T' profile with deep working knowledge in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning and expertise in NLP. I completed my Master's thesis while being a full-time Machine Learning Engineer at Riversand (super proud).

I started working as a software engineer and successfully transitioned into data scientist role. I possess skills situated at the convergence of data science, machine learning and software engineering. Though my strong suit is doing research in AI. I have a strong curiosity and constantly look for opportunities to learn new and different things.
