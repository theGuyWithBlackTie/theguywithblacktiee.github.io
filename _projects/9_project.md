title: Transfer Learning for Sleep Stage Detection
description: Addressing the challenge of limited patient data in a hospital setting, I investigated the application of transfer learning by fine-tuning machine learning models initially trained on publicly available datasets. Through experimentation, I identified the optimal layers within the model where parameter learning effectively takes place. Furthermore, I conducted a separate experiment involving the implementation of a Variation Autoencoder with KL-Divergence. This approach aimed to minimize discrepancies between the two datasets during classification tasks. Unfortunately, the unavailability of code stems from authorization issues.
