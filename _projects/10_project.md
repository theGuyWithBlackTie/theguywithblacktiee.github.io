title: Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification-XMTC
description: Developed a hierarchical neural network structure to assign 20,000 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) tree terms to biomedical papers, overcoming the issue of highly skewed data points for each label. Implemented a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a fully connected neural network to predict labels at different levels within the MeSH tree.
